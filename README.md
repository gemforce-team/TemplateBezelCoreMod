# Template Bezel Core Mod

## Description
This is a template Bezel CoreMod. Bezel CoreMods perform modifications to the base game's logic via editing the compiled AS3 bytecode.

## Installing the mod
### Important warning! Template Bezel Core Mod depends on [Bezel Mod Loader](https://github.com/gemforce-team/BezelModLoader).
#### This mod really shouldn't be installed, and instead serve as a mod programmer's template. There is no reason to install it, as it performs exactly one text edit, and it could theoretically cause issues for another mod that may wish to perform similar edits.

# Bug reports and feedback
